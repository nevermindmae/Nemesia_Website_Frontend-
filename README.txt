Nemesia (static demo)

How to run:
- Option 1: Open index.html directly in a browser (works, but some browsers restrict localStorage in file:// mode).
- Option 2 (recommended): Serve locally:
  - Python:  python -m http.server 8000
  - Then open: http://localhost:8000

What's included:
- 4 pages: Homepage, Catalogue, Visualise, Forum
- Apple-like minimal layout, smooth scrolling (Lenis), reveal animations + scroll triggers (GSAP)
- "Mock backend" (assets/js/mockBackend.js): localStorage persistence + simulated latency

Notes:
- This is a UI/UX demo with dummy content. Not medical advice.
